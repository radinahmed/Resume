                Collaborated with peers in the development of a multiplayer Rock, Paper, Scissors game which used python, javascript and
                html/css and websockets for instant communication between the backend and frontend. Ssed session cookies to manage login
                sessions. Wrote technical documentation for the libraries and firmware we used.

                Created an online Web based chat application, using Flask, SQLAlchemy, and websockets. Made the website compatible with
                some phones through media queries. Used scaling formulas to scale images. Image files such as jpeg were transferred via
                websockets. This project also used an SQL database and cookies to manage user sessions. Deployed the website using docker
                compose, nginx, secure encryption and digitalocean droplets.

                Written a 2048 game using C programming language, Code Composer Studio and a Tiva c series tm4c123gh6pm processor. It
                utilized the UART and Timer of the microcontroller to make use of interrupts. Key feature of this game was to make multiple
                random numbers without any built in methods.
